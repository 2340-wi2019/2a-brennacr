            <h1>The Wizard of Oz!</h1>
            <p><strong><span id="femalename1"></span></strong>lived in the 
            midst of the great<strong><span id="state1"></span></strong>
            <strong><span id="geographical"></span></strong>, with Uncle<strong><span id="malename"></span></strong>,
             who was a <strong><span id="occupation"></span></strong>, and Aunt <strong><span id="femalename2"></span></strong>, 
             who was the farmer's wife. Their house<br> was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried
            by the wagon many miles. There were four walls, a<br> floor and a roof,
            which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking
            <strong><span id="noun1"></span></strong>, a <strong><span id="noun2"></span></strong>
            for the dishes, a table,<br> three or four chairs, and the beds. 
            Uncle <strong><span id="malename2"></span></strong> and Aunt
            <strong><span id="femalename3"></span></strong> had a big bed in one
            corner, and <strong><span id="femalename4"></span></strong> a little bed
            in another<br> corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar--
            except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone<br> cellar, 
            where the family could go in case one of those great whilwinds arose, mighty
            enough to crush any<br> building in its path. It was reached by a trap door
            in the middle of the <strong><span id="noun3"></span></strong>, from which a 
            ladder led down to the<br> small, dark hole. <br>
            When <strong><span id="femalename5"></span></strong> stood in the doorway
            and looked around, she could see nothing but the great 
            <strong><span id="color1"></span></strong><strong><span id="geographical2"></span></strong>
            on every side. Not a <strong><span id="noun4"></span></strong> or a

            <strong><span id="noun5"></span></strong> broke the broad sweep of 
            flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions.
            The sun had baked the plowed land into a <strong><span id="color2"></span></strong>
            mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green,
            for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same
            <strong><span id="color3"></span></strong> color to be seen everywhere.
            Once the house had been painted, but the sun had blistered the paint and the rains 
            washed it away, and now the house was as dull and <strong><span id="color4"></span></strong>
            as everything else.</p>
